## Acknowledgements
We adapted the structure of this document from the 
[AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html) 
project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org/). <br />
We used the content from the above project for
the "Setting Up, Getting Started" and "Non-Functional Requirements" sections in 
this document as well.


## Setting up, getting started
First, **fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):

1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide 
[_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure Intellij is configured to use JDK 11
2. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: 
Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) 
to import the project into IDEA.  <br />
‚ùó Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing 
a normal Java project <br />
3. **Verify the setup**:
* Run the `seedu/bankwithus/BankWithUs.java` and try a few commands. 
You may want to refer to our User Guide for the list of commands <br />
* Run the tests to ensure they all pass

# Implementation

## Command: `help`

* If a user command begins with help, it will call a method in the UI class to print the help screen. 
*  Feature with the most basic implementation

## Command: `view-account` :

**Step 1**:

*  Calls `getAllAccountDetails()` method from the AccountList class. 

*  The `getAllAccountDetails()` method parses the `ArrayList<Account>` from the AccountLits class

*  This builds a String where each Account is separated by a newline character and the attributes of an Account is separated by `;`

**Step 2**:

*  This string is then passed to the `viewAccount()` class in UI, where the string is decoded and print to screen

*  Identify attributes that belong to a particular user by splitting the string based on a new line

*  The relevant attributes(Name, balance) of the account can ge identified by separating the string again by `;` and accessing index 0 and 1 respectively

## Command: `withdraw` :

**Step 1**:

*  Checks the args(AMOUNT to withdraw) for a negative sign in the `checkNegative()` method

**Step 2**:

*  Calls the `withdrawMoney` method in the AccountList class

*  Checks if the AMOUNT entered is empty, number of decimal places(accepts only 2 d.p) and checks if the AMOUNT to be withdrawn is less than or equal to the available balance

**Step 3**:

*  Checks if the AMOUNT to withdraw exceeds the set withdrawal limit, if any, in the `willExceedWithdrawalLimit` method of the withdrawalChecker class

**Step 4**:

*  Checks if the AMOUNT to withdraw will cause the user to default on their set savings goal; though, users can proceed at their own discretion

**Step 5**:

*  If it passes all the above checks or if the users decide to continue despite defaulting on save goal then it will call the `subtractBalance` method in the Account class

*  The `subtractBalance` will deduct the AMOUNT withdrawn from the users balance

Note: Withdrawal will be cancelled if it fails to meet withdrawal limit or if users choose to meet savings goal 

**Step 6**:

*  New balance is displayed to the user via the `showBal()` method from AccountList class that makes use of the UI class' method to print to screen

Fail save goal case

<img src="images/FailSaveGoalCase.png" width="800" />

## Command: `add-account`:

**Step 1**:

*  Calls the `createNewAccount` method in AccountList class

**Step 2**:

*  The `createNewAccount` request from the user via the interface for their username(name) and password

*  The method will continuously prompt users to enter a unique name, if a unique one wasnt already provided

**Step 3**:

*  Based on the name and balance provided, a new account is created via the `addAccount` method

**Step 4**:

*  Add account creates a new instance of an Account class with the specified attributes and appends to the current ArrayList

## Command: `deposit`:

**Step 1**:

*  Checks the args(AMOUNT to deposit) for a negative sign in the `checkNegative()` method

**Step 2**:

*  Calls the `depositMoney` method in the AccountList class

*  Checks if the AMOUNT entered is empty, number of decimal places(accepts only 2 d.p) 

**Step 3**:

*  inside the `depositMoney` method, once it passes all the checks will call the `addBalance` method from the Account class to increment the balance as appropriate

## Command: `set-save-goal`:

**Step 1**:

*  Checks the args(minimum AMOUNT to save in balance) for a negative sign in the `checkNegative()` method

**Step 2**:

*  If the AMOUNT to save is not empty then it request the user to enter a deadline for their savings goal

*  The parser then calls the `handleSaveGoal` method from the AccountList class

**Step 3**:

*  Checks if the date format entered complies with the dd-MM-yyyy format in the `isDateFormatValid` method in AccountList class

*  If data entered matches the specified formats, then it will call the `setSaveGoal` method from the Account class which will set the relevant Save goal for the main account

## Command: `show-save-goal`:

**Step 1**:

*  Calls the `showGoal` method in the AccountList class which then prints the Save Goal attributes to the UI, if save goal amount is greater than 0

## Command: `switch-to`

**Step 1**:

*  Calls the `switchMainAccount` method from teh AccountList class with the NAME of the account to switch into.

*  If that account is found the method uses the `swap` method from `Collections` to swap the account that matches the NAME into index 0

## Command: `delete`

**Step 1**:

*  Calls the `deleteAccount` method from AccountList

*  This find the index of the account that matches the NAME of the account to be deleted and removes it from the ArrayList

## Command: `set-wl`

**Step 1**:

*  Calls the `setWithdrawalLimit` method in the AccountList class

*  The method will check for a number format exception and negative number exception before setting the specified AMOUNT as the withdrawal limit

## Command: `check-wl`

**Step 1**:

*  Calls the `checkWithdrawalLimit` method in AccountList class

*  Calls the getter method which then returns the Withdrawal limit

**Step 2**:

*  Adds the attributes to a String array of size 2 which is then returned to the parser, where it then accesses the UI method to print to screen

## Summary of overall architecture

The application follows a simplified MVC architecture, where the Model is the `Storage` class, View is the `Ui` class 
and the controller is the `Parser` class and makes use of the command-line interface (CLI) where the user interacts with the 
program through the command-line prompt. The main class responsible for the CLI interaction is in the `BankWithUs` class
that uses the `Ui` class to interact with the user and the `Parser` class to "route" and deal with commands as appropriate.  
The `BankWithUS` class contains a loop that continuously prompts the user for commands and then executes the corresponding action using the `Parser` class.

The AccountList class is responsible for managing a list of Account objects. The Account class represents 
individual user accounts, and it contains attributes such as account number, balance, and savings goal. It 
also provides methods to manipulate the account data, such as depositing or withdrawing funds, checking the 
account balance, and setting the savings goal.

When the user enters a command to interact with an account, such as deposit or withdraw, the `Parser` class calls 
the corresponding method in the AccountList class, which in turn calls the corresponding method in the Account 
class to modify the account data. If the command entered by the user is to create a new account, the AccountList 
class creates a new Account object and adds it to the ArrayList.

The UI class, called `Ui`, is responsible for displaying messages to the user and decoding and displaying 
account information. It contains methods to display messages such as account creation success or failure and prompts 
for user input. It also has methods to display account information, such as the account balance, savings goal, and 
transaction history.

Overall, the architecture is designed to separate concerns between the UI, the account management logic, and the 
individual account data. The `Parser` class acts as the intermediary between the user and the account management 
logic, while the `Ui` class handles the display of information to the user. The AccountList class manages the 
list of accounts, and the Account class represents the individual accounts and their data.

that provides users with an easy and quick way to manage their financial 
transactions and budget accordingly. With its wide range of features and 
easy-to-use command syntax, BankWithUs makes it simple for users to manage their finances on the go.


### Target user profile

The target audience for the command line-based Banking System is individuals who value 
efficiency and simplicity in their financial management. This group includes students, 
freelancers, and small business owners who are looking for a fast and straightforward way to manage their finances.


### Value proposition

People who can type fast may benefit more from the CLI 
version of the banking system as it allows for 
quick navigation and interaction with the system using keyboard shortcuts. 
This can lead to a faster and more efficient workflow compared to using a graphical user interface (GUI), 
which may require more clicks and navigation. Additionally, fast typers may prefer the simplicity and 
minimalism of a CLI interface, as it provides only the essential information and features needed to manage their finances.

and a withdrawal limit of 500. <br />

* Test case: `withdraw 100` <br />
Expected: A successful message and the new balance will be shown, and the balance of the account should be reduced by 100 <br />
  ```
  Withdrawal successful!
  You have $600.00 remaining!
  ```
* Test case: `withdraw 1001` <br />
Expected: An alert message `You do not have sufficient Balance` will be shown, and the balance of the account should not be changed <br />
* Test case: `withdraw 501` <br />
Expected: An alert message will be shown, including the current withdrawal limit 
 and the amount you have withdrawn in this month. The balance of the account should not be changed <br />
The alert message should be similar to this: <br />
  ```
  Apologies! Your transaction did not go through as it will result
  in you exceeding your withdrawal limit!
  Withdrawal limit is currently $500.
  You have withdrawn $100 this month.
  ```

* Test case: `withdraw abcd` <br />
Expected: An error message `The input is not a valid number! Please try again.` will be shown, and the balance of the account should not be changed <br />
* Test case: `withdraw -100` <br />
Expected: An error message `Negative amount entered!` will be shown, and the balance of the account should not be changed <br />


#### Deposit
Similar to withdraw, you can try out the following test cases: <br />

* Test case: `deposit 100` <br />
Expected: A successful message and the new balance will be shown, 
 and the balance of the account should be increased by 100 <br />
The successful message should be similar to this: <br />
  ```
  New deposit added!
  You have $800.00 remaining!
  ```
* Test case: `deposit abc` <br />
Expected: An error message  `The input is not a valid number! Please try again.` will be shown, and the balance of the account should not be changed <br />
* Test case: `deposit -100` <br />
Expected: An error message`Negative amount entered!`will be shown, and the balance of the account should not be changed <br />
