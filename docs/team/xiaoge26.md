## Overview

Helped create a CLI-based application that acts like a banking app. Users can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, set save goal, set withdrawal limit, and view previous transactions with this application.

### Enhancements implemented

I developed the add account and add deposit methods at the very early stage, which allows users to add a new deposit to the current account. 
I would like to thank all my teammates who have modified and improved these feature later to suit the evolved needs of the application. <br />
* Add Account Feature [#26](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/pull/26)
  * Allows the user to add a new account
* Add Deposit Feature [#42](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/pull/42)
  * Allows the user to add a new deposit to the current account 


I have also developed the features related to the `Transaction` and `TransactionList` classes, including adding, 
deleting, listing, parsing, saving, and loading the transactions. <br />
* Add and View Transaction Feature [#74](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/pull/74)
  * `Transaction` class and `TransactionList` class store the transactions of the user <br />
  * `TransactionEncoder` and `TransactionDecoder` Classes help save and load the transaction data
  * Allows the transaction data to be automatically added to the `TransactionList` when the user adds a new transaction
  * Allows the user to view the transaction history of all the accounts
  * Allows the user to delete a transaction from the transaction history
* Delete Transaction Feature [#159](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/pull/159) [#163](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T13-3/tp/pull/163)
  * Allow the user to delete a transaction from the transaction history
  * Automatically delete all the transactions of a particular account when the user deletes the account <br />

[AddressBoook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html) <br />
* Further modified the DG template and fixed the typos and standardized the format (Uppercase/lowercase issues, no full stop at the end of a bullet point etc.)

* Updated User/Developer Guides that are not specific to a feature e.g. Non-Functional Requirements and Instructions for Manual Testing)
